   *

   *  destination process with a matching @c recv call.
   *
   *  The given @p value must be suitable for transmission over
   *  MPI. There are several classes of types that meet these
   *  requirements:
   *
   *    - Types with mappings to MPI data types: If @c
   *    is_mpi_datatype<T> is convertible to @c mpl::true_, then @p
   *    value will be transmitted using the MPI data type
   *    @c get_mpi_datatype<T>(). All primitive C++ data types that have
   *    MPI equivalents, e.g., @c int, @c float, @c char, @c double,
   *    etc., have built-in mappings to MPI data types. You may turn a
   *    Serializable type with fixed structure into an MPI data type by
   *    specializing @c is_mpi_datatype for your type.
   *
   *    - Serializable types: Any type that provides the @c serialize()
   *    functionality required by the Boost.Serialization library can be
   *    transmitted and received.
   *
   *    - Packed archives and skeletons: Data that has been packed into
   *    an @c mpi::packed_oarchive or the skeletons of data that have
   *    been backed into an @c mpi::packed_skeleton_oarchive can be
   *    transmitted, but will be received as @c mpi::packed_iarchive and
   *    @c mpi::packed_skeleton_iarchive, respectively, to allow the
   *    values (or skeletons) to be extracted by the destination process.
   *
   *    - Content: Content associated with a previously-transmitted
   *    skeleton can be transmitted by @c send and received by @c
   *    recv. The receiving process may only receive content into the
   *    content of a value that has been constructed with the matching
   *    skeleton.
   *
   *  For types that have mappings to an MPI data type (including the
   *  content of a type), an invocation of this routine will result in
   *  a single MPI_Send call. For variable-length data, e.g.,
   *  serialized types and packed archives, two messages will be sent
   *  via MPI_Send: one containing the length of the data and the
   *  second containing the data itself.
   * 
   *  Std::vectors of MPI data type
   *  are considered variable size, e.g. their number of elements is 
   *  unknown and must be transmitted (although the serialization process
   *  is skipped). You can use the array specialized versions of 
   *  communication methods is both sender and receiver know the vector 
   *  size.
   *  
   *  Note that the transmission mode for variable-length data is an 
   *  implementation detail that is subject to change.
   *
   *  @param dest The rank of the remote process to which the data
   *  will be sent.
   *
   *  @param tag The tag that will be associated with this message. Tags
   *  may be any integer between zero and an implementation-defined
   *  upper limit. This limit is accessible via @c environment::max_tag().
   *
   *  @param value The value that will be transmitted to the
   *  receiver. The type @c T of this value must meet the aforementioned
   *  criteria for transmission.
